7/26 - Started following the tutorial([link](https://www.robinwieruch.de/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/#react-firebase-protected-routes)) to try and learn some more about Firebase authentication with React. Eventually would like to edit my [budget](https://gentle-depths-77002.herokuapp.com/) and [chat room](https://bloc-chat-mouten57.herokuapp.com/) apps so that only certain people have access. 
  For the chatroom, I'd love to create some private chat rooms that require logins. Or upon logging in, a new chatroom is suddenly available to you.

  For the budget app, I'd love to have a sign in at the very beginning and you will only see the budget that you have been working on. So it should be able to handle different users and keep data on Firebase.
